# What is Saposs component?

As known, a software or application is made from a set of all modules. In Saposs, each module is made from components such as view, handlers and services. All Saposs components can be connected by using Saposs APIs indirectly.

- View: user control or forms, etc...
- Handler: business logics or code-behind.
- Service: a set of .NET APIs(e.g. helpers, utilities...).
