# Manage Live Projects

<div style="text-align: justify">
Starting from the new version 1.4.0 of Saposs WF, you're able to manage your live projects by signing in and then synchronizing your projects anywhere as long as your internet connection is available. Here's a new feature which helps any developer to be able to release any project anywhere easily. Currently, Saposs Aquarium isn't supported yet.
